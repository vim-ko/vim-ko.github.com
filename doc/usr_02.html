이 장에는 Vim으로 파일을 편집하기 위해 딱 필요한 만큼의 정보가 담겨 있습니다.
능숙하고 빠르진 못해도 편집은 할 수 있을 겁니다.  앞으로 나올 모든 내용들의
기초가 되므로 충분한 시간을 갖고 이 명령들을 연습하기 바랍니다.

</pre><hr><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.1">02.1</a>*</b>	처음으로 Vim 띄우기

Vim을 시작하려면 다음과 같은 명령을 입력합니다:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	gvim file.txt</code>
<code class="example"></code>
UNIX에서는 아무 명령줄에서나 입력해도 됩니다.  만약 Microsoft Windows라면,
명령 프롬프트 또는 MS-DOS 명령창을 열고 입력합니다.
   어느 경우라도 Vim은 file.txt라는 파일을 편집하는 상태로 시작합니다.  새
파일이기 때문에 빈 창이 나타납니다.  다음과 같은 화면이 보일 겁니다:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">#					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">"file" [새 파일]			</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+
		('#"는 커서의 위치를 나타냅니다.)

물결표시 (~) 줄들은 파일의 내용이 아닌 부분을 나타냅니다.  즉, Vim은 더 이상
표시할 파일의 내용이 없으면 물결표시 줄을 대신 표시합니다.  화면 맨 아래에
있는 메시지 줄이 파일 이름이 file.txt이고 새 파일을 만드려고 한다는 사실을
보여줍니다.  메시지는 다음 메시지 전까지의 임시 정보이며, 메시지 줄은 계속해서
새 메시지로 덮어 쓰여집니다.


Vim 명령

앞에서 확인한 것처럼 gvim 명령은 편집하기 위해 새 창을 엽니다.  다음 명령을
이용한다면:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	vim file.txt</code>
<code class="example"></code>
명령창 안에서 편집을 할 수 있습니다.  다시말해, xterm 안에서 띄운다면 Vim은
이미 열려 있는 xterm 창을 활용합니다.  Microsoft Windows의 명령 프롬프트에서
띄우면 편집을 그 창 안에서 할 수 있습니다.  gvim이나 vim, 둘 다 나타나는
글자들은 똑같지만, gvim에서는 메뉴 막대와 같은 기능들을 더 쓸 수 있습니다.
자세한 내용은 나중에 살펴봅시다.

</pre><hr><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.2">02.2</a>*</b>	Inserting text

The Vim editor is a modal editor.  That means that the editor behaves
differently, depending on which mode you are in.  The two basic modes are
called Normal mode and Insert mode.  In Normal mode the characters you type
are commands.  In Insert mode the characters are inserted as text.
   Since you have just started Vim it will be in Normal mode.  To start Insert
mode you type the "i" command (i for Insert).  Then you can enter
the text.  It will be inserted into the file.  Do not worry if you make
mistakes; you can correct them later.  To enter the following programmer's
limerick, this is what you type:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	iA very intelligent turtle</code>
<code class="example">	Found programming UNIX a hurdle</code>
<code class="example"></code>
After typing "turtle" you press the <code class="special">&lt;Enter&gt;</code> key to start a new line.  Finally
you press the <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> key to stop Insert mode and go back to Normal mode.  You
now have two lines of text in your Vim window:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">A very intelligent turtle		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">Found programming UNIX a hurdle	</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">					</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+


WHAT IS THE MODE?

To be able to see what mode you are in, type this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:set showmode</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You will notice that when typing the colon Vim moves the cursor to the last
line of the window.  That's where you type colon commands (commands that start
with a colon).  Finish this command by pressing the <code class="special">&lt;Enter&gt;</code> key (all commands
that start with a colon are finished this way).
   Now, if you type the "i" command Vim will display --INSERT-- at the bottom
of the window.  This indicates you are in Insert mode.

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">A very intelligent turtle		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">Found programming UNIX a hurdle	</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">-- INSERT --				</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+

If you press <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> to go back to Normal mode the last line will be made blank.


GETTING OUT OF TROUBLE

One of the problems for Vim novices is mode confusion, which is caused by
forgetting which mode you are in or by accidentally typing a command that
switches modes.  To get back to Normal mode, no matter what mode you are in,
press the <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> key.  Sometimes you have to press it twice.  If Vim beeps back
at you, you already are in Normal mode.

</pre><hr><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.3">02.3</a>*</b>	Moving around

After you return to Normal mode, you can move around by using these keys:

	h   left						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="hjkl">hjkl</a>*</b>
	j   down
	k   up
	l   right

At first, it may appear that these commands were chosen at random.  After all,
who ever heard of using l for right?  But actually, there is a very good
reason for these choices: Moving the cursor is the most common thing you do in
an editor, and these keys are on the home row of your right hand.  In other
words, these commands are placed where you can type them the fastest
(especially when you type with ten fingers).

	<code class="note">Note:</code>
	You can also move the cursor by using the arrow keys.  If you do,
	however, you greatly slow down your editing because to press the arrow
	keys, you must move your hand from the text keys to the arrow keys.
	Considering that you might be doing it hundreds of times an hour, this
	can take a significant amount of time.
	   Also, there are keyboards which do not have arrow keys, or which
	locate them in unusual places; therefore, knowing the use of the hjkl
	keys helps in those situations.

One way to remember these commands is that h is on the left, l is on the
right and j points down.  In a picture:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">		       k</code>
<code class="example">		   h     l</code>
<code class="example">		     j</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The best way to learn these commands is by using them.  Use the "i" command to
insert some more lines of text.  Then use the hjkl keys to move around and
insert a word somewhere.  Don't forget to press <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> to go back to Normal
mode.  The |<a href="usr_01.html#vimtutor">vimtutor</a>| is also a nice way to learn by doing.

For Japanese users, Hiroshi Iwatani suggested using this:

			Komsomolsk
			    ^
			    |
	   Huan Ho	<code class="special">&lt;--- ---&gt;</code>  Los Angeles
	(Yellow river)	    |
			    v
			  Java (the island, not the programming language)

</pre><hr><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.4">02.4</a>*</b>	Deleting characters

To delete a character, move the cursor over it and type "x".  (This is a
throwback to the old days of the typewriter, when you deleted things by typing
xxxx over them.)  Move the cursor to the beginning of the first line, for
example, and type xxxxxxx (seven x's) to delete "A very ".  The result should
look like this:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">intelligent turtle			</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">Found programming UNIX a hurdle	</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">					</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+

Now you can insert new text, for example by typing:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	iA young <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
This begins an insert (the i), inserts the words "A young", and then exits
insert mode (the final <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code>).	The result:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">A young intelligent turtle		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">Found programming UNIX a hurdle	</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">					</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+


DELETING A LINE

To delete a whole line use the "dd" command.  The following line will
then move up to fill the gap:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">Found programming UNIX a hurdle	</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">					</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+


DELETING A LINE BREAK

In Vim you can join two lines together, which means that the line break
between them is deleted.  The "J" command does this.
   Take these two lines:

<code class="section">	A young intelligent </code>
<code class="section">	turtle </code>

Move the cursor to the first line and press "J":

<code class="section">	A young intelligent turtle </code>

</pre><hr><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.5">02.5</a>*</b>	Undo and Redo

Suppose you delete too much.  Well, you can type it in again, but an easier
way exists.  The "u" command undoes the last edit.  Take a look at this in
action: After using "dd" to delete the first line, "u" brings it back.
   Another one: Move the cursor to the A in the first line:

<code class="section">	A young intelligent turtle </code>

Now type xxxxxxx to delete "A young".  The result is as follows:

<code class="section">	 intelligent turtle </code>

Type "u" to undo the last delete.  That delete removed the g, so the undo
restores the character.

<code class="section">	g intelligent turtle </code>

The next u command restores the next-to-last character deleted:

<code class="section">	ng intelligent turtle </code>

The next u command gives you the u, and so on:

<code class="section">	ung intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	oung intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	young intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	 young intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	A young intelligent turtle </code>

	<code class="note">Note:</code>
	If you type "u" twice, and the result is that you get the same text
	back, you have Vim configured to work Vi compatible.  Look here to fix
	this: |<a href="usr_01.html#not-compatible">not-compatible</a>|.
	   This text assumes you work "The Vim Way".  You might prefer to use
	the good old Vi way, but you will have to watch out for small
	differences in the text then.


REDO

If you undo too many times, you can press <code class="keystroke">CTRL-R</code> (redo) to reverse the
preceding command.  In other words, it undoes the undo.  To see this in
action, press <code class="keystroke">CTRL-R</code> twice.  The character A and the space after it disappear:

<code class="section">	young intelligent turtle </code>

There's a special version of the undo command, the "U" (undo line) command.
The undo line command undoes all the changes made on the last line that was
edited.  Typing this command twice cancels the preceding "U".

<code class="section">	A very intelligent turtle </code>
	  xxxx				Delete very

<code class="section">	A intelligent turtle </code>
		      xxxxxx		Delete turtle

<code class="section">	A intelligent </code>
					Restore line with "U"
<code class="section">	A very intelligent turtle </code>
					Undo "U" with "u"
<code class="section">	A intelligent </code>

The "U" command is a change by itself, which the "u" command undoes and <code class="keystroke">CTRL-R</code>
redoes.  This might be a bit confusing.  Don't worry, with "u" and <code class="keystroke">CTRL-R</code> you
can go to any of the situations you had.  More about that in section ||.

</pre><hr><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.6">02.6</a>*</b>	Other editing commands

Vim has a large number of commands to change the text.  See |<code class="badlink">Q_in</code>| and below.
Here are a few often used ones.


APPENDING

The "i" command inserts a character before the character under the cursor.
That works fine; but what happens if you want to add stuff to the end of the
line?  For that you need to insert text after the cursor.  This is done with
the "a" (append) command.
   For example, to change the line

<code class="section">	and that's not saying much for the turtle. </code>
to
<code class="section">	and that's not saying much for the turtle!!! </code>

move the cursor over to the dot at the end of the line. Then type "x" to
delete the period.  The cursor is now positioned at the end of the line on the
e in turtle.  Now type
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	a!!!<code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
to append three exclamation points after the e in turtle:

<code class="section">	and that's not saying much for the turtle!!! </code>


OPENING UP A NEW LINE

The "o" command creates a new, empty line below the cursor and puts Vim in
Insert mode.  Then you can type the text for the new line.
   Suppose the cursor is somewhere in the first of these two lines:

<code class="section">	A very intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	Found programming UNIX a hurdle </code>

If you now use the "o" command and type new text:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	oThat liked using Vim<code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
The result is:

<code class="section">	A very intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	That liked using Vim </code>
<code class="section">	Found programming UNIX a hurdle </code>

The "O" command (uppercase) opens a line above the cursor.


USING A COUNT

Suppose you want to move up nine lines.  You can type "kkkkkkkkk" or you can
enter the command "9k".  In fact, you can precede many commands with a number.
Earlier in this chapter, for instance, you added three exclamation points to
the end of a line by typing "a!!!<code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code>".  Another way to do this is to use the
command "3a!<code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code>".  The count of 3 tells the command that follows to triple
its effect.  Similarly, to delete three characters, use the command "3x".  The
count always comes before the command it applies to.

</pre><hr><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.7">02.7</a>*</b>	Getting out

To exit, use the "ZZ" command.  This command writes the file and exits.

	<code class="note">Note:</code>
	Unlike many other editors, Vim does not automatically make a backup
	file.  If you type "ZZ", your changes are committed and there's no
	turning back.  You can configure the Vim editor to produce backup
	files, see |<a href="usr_07.html#07.4">07.4</a>|.


DISCARDING CHANGES

Sometimes you will make a sequence of changes and suddenly realize you were
better off before you started.  Not to worry; Vim has a
quit-and-throw-things-away command.  It is:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:q!</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Don't forget to press <code class="special">&lt;Enter&gt;</code> to finish the command.

For those of you interested in the details, the three parts of this command
are the colon (:), which enters Command-line mode; the q command, which tells
the editor to quit; and the override command modifier (!).
   The override command modifier is needed because Vim is reluctant to throw
away changes.  If you were to just type ":q", Vim would display an error
message and refuse to exit:

<code class="section">	E37: No write since last change (use ! to override) </code>

By specifying the override, you are in effect telling Vim, "I know that what
I'm doing looks stupid, but I'm a big boy and really want to do this."

If you want to continue editing with Vim: The ":e!" command reloads the
original version of the file.

</pre><hr><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.8">02.8</a>*</b>	Finding help

Everything you always wanted to know can be found in the Vim help files.
Don't be afraid to ask!
   To get generic help use this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You could also use the first function key <code class="special">&lt;F1&gt;</code>.  If your keyboard has a <code class="special">&lt;Help&gt;</code>
key it might work as well.
   If you don't supply a subject, ":help" displays the general help window.
The creators of Vim did something very clever (or very lazy) with the help
system: They made the help window a normal editing window.  You can use all
the normal Vim commands to move through the help information.  Therefore h, j,
k, and l move left, down, up and right.
   To get out of the help window, use the same command you use to get out of
the editor: "ZZ".  This will only close the help window, not exit Vim.

As you read the help text, you will notice some text enclosed in vertical bars
(for example, |<code class="badlink">help</code>|).  This indicates a hyperlink.  If you position the
cursor anywhere between the bars and press CTRL-] (jump to tag), the help
system takes you to the indicated subject.  (For reasons not discussed here,
the Vim terminology for a hyperlink is tag.  So CTRL-] jumps to the location
of the tag given by the word under the cursor.)
   After a few jumps, you might want to go back.  <code class="keystroke">CTRL-T</code> (pop tag) takes you
back to the preceding position.  <code class="keystroke">CTRL-O</code> (jump to older position) also works
nicely here.
   At the top of the help screen, there is the notation <b class="vimtag">*<a name="help.txt">help.txt</a>*</b>.  This name
between "*" characters is used by the help system to define a tag (hyperlink
destination).
   See |<a href="usr_29.html#29.1">29.1</a>| for details about using tags.

To get help on a given subject, use the following command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help <code class="special">{subject}</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
To get help on the "x" command, for example, enter the following:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help x</code>
<code class="example"></code>
To find out how to delete text, use this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help deleting</code>
<code class="example"></code>
To get a complete index of all Vim commands, use the following command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help index</code>
<code class="example"></code>
When you need to get help for a control character command (for example,
<code class="keystroke">CTRL-A</code>), you need to spell it with the prefix "CTRL-".
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help <code class="keystroke">CTRL-A</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
The Vim editor has many different modes.  By default, the help system displays
the normal-mode commands.  For example, the following command displays help
for the normal-mode <code class="keystroke">CTRL-H</code> command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help <code class="keystroke">CTRL-H</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
To identify other modes, use a mode prefix.  If you want the help for the
insert-mode version of a command, use "i_".  For <code class="keystroke">CTRL-H</code> this gives you the
following command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help i_<code class="keystroke">CTRL-H</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
When you start the Vim editor, you can use several command-line arguments.
These all begin with a dash (-).  To find what the -t argument does, for
example, use the command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help -t</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The Vim editor has a number of options that enable you to configure and
customize the editor.  If you want help for an option, you need to enclose it
in single quotation marks.  To find out what the 'number' option does, for
example, use the following command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help 'number'</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The table with all mode prefixes can be found here: |<a href="help.html#help-context">help-context</a>|.

Special keys are enclosed in angle brackets.  To find help on the up-arrow key
in Insert mode, for instance, use this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help i_<code class="special">&lt;Up&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
If you see an error message that you don't understand, for example:

<code class="section">	E37: No write since last change (use ! to override) </code>

You can use the error ID at the start to find help about it:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help E37</code>
<code class="example"></code>
